At the conclusion of the litigation, the Respondent failed to clearly advise her client that the representation had ended and began assisting her client in seeking financing to pay off the balance owed to the Respondent.

The Respondent was retained to prepare an opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's motion to reopen her client's removal proceedings. Upon receipt of a labor certification allowing the Respondent's employer to file an Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers on behalf of the client, the Respondent advised the client that an opposition was no longer necessary because the client could pursue an adjustment of status and would want his case reopened. The Respondent agreed to represent the client in connection with the Petition and the subsequent Application for Adjustment of Status. The Respondent completed and mailed the Petition but did not receive notice from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acknowledging receipt or take any timely action to confirm that they had received the Petition before the labor certification expired.

The Respondent's law firm website and letterhead listed his Maryland address as his law firm address and failed to adequately reflect that the Respondent was licensed to practice law in Illinois, not Maryland, or that his practice was limited to federal military practice. The Respondent's retainer agreement failed to specify what legal services would be provided for his client's flat fee, and the Respondent refused his client's request for a refund after the client terminated the representation due to his failure to advance her case in any meaningful way. In another matter, the Respondent charged an unreasonable fee when he collected payment, failed to advance his client's case or provide any services of value, and failed to refund any portion of the payment."
