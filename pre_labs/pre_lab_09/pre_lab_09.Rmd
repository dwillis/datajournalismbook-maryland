```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Task 1: Load libraries and settings

**Task** Run the following code in the gray-colored codeblock below to load the tidyverse library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

### Task 2: Get Maryland GOP statewide candidates data

First, let's get some data and work with it. Let's use a simple CSV of total votes cast for four Maryland Republicans who ran for statewide office in the 2022 general election. Let's look at it.

**Task** Load the Maryland GOP statewide candidates CSV file

```{r}
md_gop_cands <- read_csv("data/md_gop_cands.csv")
```

### Task 3: Log into Datawrapper

**Task** Log into [datawrapper.de](https://www.datawrapper.de/). Once logged in, you'll click on New Chart.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper1.png")
```

### Task 4: Upload the CSV File

The first thing we'll do is upload the GOP candidates CSV that's in the pre_lab_09/data folder.

**Task** Click on XLS/CSV and upload the md_gop_cands.csv file.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper2.png")
```

### Task 5: Inspect the Data

Next up is to check and see what Datawrappper did with our data when we uploaded it. As you can see from the text on the left, if it's blue, it's a number. If it's green, it's a date. If it's black, it's text. Red means there's a problem. This data is very clean, so it imports cleanly.

**Task** Look at the uploaded data, then click on the "Proceed" button.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper3.png"))
```

### Task 6: Make a Chart

Now we make a chart. Bar chart comes up by default, which is good, because with totals, that's what we have.

**Task** Click on Refine. The first option we want to change is column we're using for the bars, which defaults to "Early Voting". Let's make it "Votes":

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper4.png")
```

Let's also choose to sort the bars so that the largest value (and bar appears first). We do that by clicking on the "Sort bars" button.

### Task 7: Annotate the Chart

Now we need to annotate our charts. Every chart needs a title, a source line and a credit line. Most need chatter (called `description` here).

**Task** Click on the "Annotate" tab to get add the title and description. Really think about the title and description: the title is like a headline and the description is provides some additional context. Another way to think about it: the title is the most important lesson from the graphic, and the description could be the next most important lesson or could provide more context to the title.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper5.png")
```

### Task 7: Publish the Chart

**Task** Click the "Publish & Embed" tab, then click on the "PNG" icon. Finally, click the "Download image" button and save that file in the pre_lab_09 folder.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper6.png")
```

Some publication systems allow for the embedding of HTML into a post or a story. Some don't. The only way to know is to ask someone at your publication. Every publication system on the planet, though, can publish an image. So there's always a way to export your chart as a PNG file, which you can upload like any photo.

**Answer** Copy the url of the graphic you published here. It will begin with <https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/>. Don't copy the browser's current url.

### Task 8: Make a Choropleth Map

Let's create a choropleth map - one that shows variations between the percentage of votes received by Wes Moore across Maryland counties. We'll read that in from the data folder.

**Task** Run the following code to load the Maryland election results data.

```{r}
md_gov_county <- read_csv("data/md_gov_county.csv")
```

In order to make a map, we need to be able to tell Datawrapper that a certain column contains geographic information (besides the name of the county). The easiest way to do that for U.S. maps is to use something called a [FIPS Code](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html). You should read about them so you understand what they are, and think of them as a unique identifier for some geographical entity like a state or county. Our md_gov_county dataframe has a FIPS code for each county, but if you ever need one for a county, this is a solved problem thanks to the Tigris library that we used in pre_lab 9.

**Task** Write code to add columns showing the total number of votes for each county and the percentage of votes received by Wes Moore in each county (you did this in Lab 9!), then replace the CSV file in the data folder with it.

```{r}

# calculate the total number of votes and Moore's percentage, saving it back to the md_gov_county dataframe

write_csv(md_gov_county, "data/md_gov_county.csv")
```

**Task** Go back to Datawrapper and click on "New Map". Click on "Choropleth map" and then choose "USA \>\> Counties (2022)" for the map base and click the Proceed button.

**Task** Now we can upload the `md_gov_county.csv` file from our data folder using the Upload File button. It should look like the following image:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper7.png")
```

We'll need to make sure that Datawrapper understands what the data is and where the FIPS code is.

**Task** Click on the "Match" tab and make sure that yours looks like the image below (your column for Moore's percentage may have a different name):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datawrapper8.png")
```

**Task** Click the "Proceed" button (you should have to click it twice, since the first time it will tell you that there's no data for 3,197 counties - the rest of the U.S.). That will take you to the Visualize tab.

You'll see that the map currently is of the whole nation, and we only have Maryland data. Let's fix that.

**Task** Look for "Hide regions without data" under Appearance, and click the slider icon to enable that feature. You should see a map zoomed into Maryland with some counties in various colors. **Answer** Describe the changes from the previous map

But it's a little rough visually, so let's clean that up.

**Task** Look for the "Show color legend" label and add a caption for the legend, which is the horizontal bar under the title. It represents the extent of the data from smallest number of loans to largest. Then click on the "Annotate" tab to add a title, description, data source and byline. The title should represent the headline, while the description should be a longer phrase that tells people what they are looking at.

That's better, but check out the tooltip by hovering over a county. It's not super helpful. Let's change the tooltip behavior to show the county name and a better-formatted number.

**Task** Click the "Customize tooltips" button so it expands down. Change {{ fips_code }} to {{ county }} and {{ pctmoore }} to {{ FORMAT(pctmoore, "00.0%")}} **Answer** Describe the changes from the previous map

**Task** Add a note that says that this data represents votes counted through Nov. 10 and an alternative description for screen readers. This should be a simple description of what your map shows. Experiment with the "Show labels" button, choosing the "by column" option for Type to display some or all of the county names.

Ok, that looks better. Let's publish!

**Task** Click the "Proceed" button until you get to the "Publish & Embed" tab, then click "Publish Now". Copy the published URL (like you did for the chart above) and paste it below. **Answer** Put the URL of your map here.
